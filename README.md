# PolyBet: an interative polyglot alphabet
Abstract: a site to help polyglot literacy for children.

## Background
In order to raise my children in both portuguese and deutsch languages (as my wife was raise speaking riograndenser hunsrickisch â€” a deutsch dialet from southern Brazil), I wrote Google Docs with some images selected together with my first-born.

To train my HTML and CSS knowledge and skills, I start to build a project to turn this archives more interactive and practical.
